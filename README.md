## Lead flow (`/api/submit-enquiry`)

In order, never skip a step:

1. **IP blocklist** — reject spammer IPs silently (returns fake 200)
2. **Attribution capture** — `buildTouch(req, p)` pulls gclid/gbraid/wbraid/utm/device/browser/geo from cookies + headers + body. Loads existing KV session by `sl_session_id` cookie.
3. **Duplicate detection** — `findDuplicateLead` scores 4 signals (email, phone, IP, name). 2+ matches flags the Monday row. Exception: an IP-only match also flags when the original lead is under 14 days old — same-household detection (parent + student enquiring separately from home wifi). Older IP-only matches stay unflagged because shared IPs (university halls, offices, mobile CGNAT) are too noisy on their own.
4. **Monday Leads board write** — full column map; flags + assignee fallback if duplicate
5. **Lead source classification** — `computeLeadSource(p)` resolves source/channel. Priority: msclkid (Bing Ads) > Bing organic > gclid/utm_campaign (Google Ads) > fbclid (Socials, default Instagram since we don't run Meta ads) > utm social > direct > Google organic > visited
6. **Resend confirmation + team email** — fired in parallel via `Promise.allSettled`
7. **Google Ads upload (Data Manager API events:ingest)** — non-fatal, alerts on fail, logs to KV `gads:events`
8. **KV session attach** — links Monday id + email to the session record

`api/submit-stayluxe.js` mirrors steps 1-6 (no Google Ads upload — Stay Luxe doesn't run ads).

## Conversion actions + Google Ads counting

| Step | Action env var | Count | Window | Source |
|------|---------------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 NEW (server-side enquiry) | `GOOGLE_ADS_CONVERSION_ACTION_ID` | Every | 30d | Click-based via Data Manager |
| 2 Moderate Potential | `GOOGLE_ADS_MODERATE_POTENTIAL_ACTION_ID` | Every | 90d | EC for Leads via Data Manager |
| 3 High Potential | `GOOGLE_ADS_HIGH_POTENTIAL_ACTION_ID` | Every | 90d | EC for Leads via Data Manager |
| 4 Confirmed Booking (real value) | `GOOGLE_ADS_BOOKING_ACTION_ID` | Every | 90d | EC for Leads via Data Manager |

All 4 are set to **Every** counting (not "One"). gbraid/wbraid only work with Every counting — that's a Google API restriction.

Enhanced Conversions for Leads is enabled account-wide. Step 2/3/4 omit `adIdentifiers` and rely on hashed email + phone to match. This lets bookings attribute beyond the 90-day click window — exactly the case where the booking confirms months after the click.

Click-through window on Step 4 raised to 90 days (Google max). Cannot be extended further.

---

## Google Data Manager API migration (2026-06)

Old uploads via `googleads.googleapis.com/v21/customers/{cid}:uploadClickConversions` are being blocked in 2026. All conversion + EC-for-Leads uploads moved to:

- **Endpoint**: `https://datamanager.googleapis.com/v1/events:ingest`
- **Scope**: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datamanager`
- **Helper**: `api/_dataManager.js` (ingestEvents, conversionDestination, buildUserIdentifiers, consent, hashing)

Key field renames vs old API:
- `conversionDateTime` -> `eventTimestamp` (RFC3339, not the old `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss+zz:zz`)
- `currencyCode` -> `currency`
- `conversion_action` (resource name) -> `destinations[].productDestinationId` (bare integer)
- `userIdentifiers` moves into `events[].userData.userIdentifiers`
- `hashedEmail` / `hashedPhoneNumber` -> oneof union `emailAddress` / `phoneNumber` / `address`

Headers changed:
- DROP `developer-token`
- DROP `login-customer-id` (now in body as `destinations[].loginAccount.accountId`)
- ADD `x-goog-user-project: <GCP_PROJECT_ID>` (REQUIRED, or 403 with no clue)

Address gotcha:
- Sending an `address` identifier requires ALL of `givenName + familyName + regionCode + postalCode` together. Partial address = 400 INVALID_ARGUMENT. We don't collect postcode on the form, so `buildUserIdentifiers` skips the address block entirely and relies on email + phone only.

Customer Match (audienceMembers:ingest) deferred to a separate project. The helper exposes `ingestAudienceMembers` ready to wire.

---

## Squarespace integration

### Reservations page

Form repo: [AlexO-Luxe/luxe-enquiry-form](https://github.com/AlexO-Luxe/luxe-enquiry-form). The production form lives in a single Squarespace Code Block on `/reservations`. Code is split into sections + scripts; redeploy any section by pasting the matching file's content into the Code Block.

The form's `slGetTrackingData()` + URL-capture IIFE + the form-mirror in the footer snippet collect: `gclid, gbraid, wbraid, fbclid, utm_*, session_id`, plus first-touch twins of all of those + first_referrer + first_landing_page + first_seen. All 90d cookies.

### Site-wide footer snippet

`public/squarespace-tracking-snippet.html` is the canonical footer code injection. Drop into Squarespace -> Settings -> Advanced -> Code Injection -> Footer. Responsibilities:

1. Mint and persist `sl_session_id` (UUID, 90d cookie)
2. Capture URL params -> `sl_*` cookies + `sl_first_*` first-touch twins (90d)
3. Capture `document.referrer` once -> `sl_first_referrer`
4. POST to `/api/track` on every page (fire-and-forget, `credentials: 'omit'` to avoid wildcard-CORS preflight rejection)
5. Mirror cookies into hidden inputs on every form submit

---

## Monitoring

### Failure alerts
Every catch block in submit-enquiry / submit-booking / submit-high-potential calls `sendGadsAlert` -> Resend email to alex@studentluxe.co.uk with subject `Google Ads upload failed — <source>`. Red header card with payload + raw error.

Helper: `api/_alert.js`. Test endpoint: `/api/test-alert?secret=<CRON_SECRET>`.

### Daily digest
Every upload attempt also goes to `logGadsEvent` -> Redis sorted set `gads:events` (35d retention). The endpoint `/api/gads-daily-summary?secret=<CRON_SECRET>&hours=24` aggregates the last N hours and emails alex@ a navy/gold card with per-action OK/fail/value/click-ID coverage + last 5 failures.

Triggered by a Claude routine (`gads-daily-summary-email`) at 09:30 London daily. The routine only fires when the Claude Code app is open — if you need bulletproof firing, mirror it as a Vercel cron in `vercel.json`.

Helper: `api/_log.js` (logGadsEvent, readGadsEvents).

### Weekly PPC summary
`api/weekly-summary.js`, Vercel cron Friday 09:00 UTC (10:00 BST). Reads PPC bookings from Monday Bookings board filtered by `date9` (close date), groups by campaign, emails alex@ with a navy header card. Manual trigger: `?secret=<CRON_SECRET>&days=N&dryRun=1`.

### Attribution backfill
`api/enrich-attribution.js`, Vercel cron daily 06:00 UTC. Finds recent Leads with a gclid but no campaign, looks the click up in Google Ads `click_view`, and writes campaign/adgroup/keyword/matchtype back to Monday. Cron uses a 3-day window; for a wider one-off sweep run manually with `?secret=<CRON_SECRET>&maxAgeDays=92&lookback=12&limit=100` (add `&dryRun=1` to preview). Per-lead outcomes: `enriched`, `not-found` (click not in click_view: Display/Demand-Gen/Search-Partners/expired), `skipped` (Meta fbclid or gbraid, no gclid to look up).

---

## Attribution dashboard

- API: `GET /api/dashboard-attribution?days=7` — joins recent Monday leads with their KV session records, returns first/last touch + multi-touch path per lead.
- UI: `/dashboard-attribution.html` (standalone) and also iframed/embedded inside the PPC dashboard in [luxe-organic-content](https://github.com/AlexO-Luxe/luxe-organic-content) via the `AttributionView` React component in `components/PpcPage.js`.

KV data shape:
```
session:<uuid>          90d   { first, last, touches[], submission }
lookup:monday:<id>      90d   sessionId
lookup:email:<email>    90d   sessionId
```

---

## Setup from scratch

If standing this up on a fresh Vercel project:

1. Clone repo, `npm install`
2. `vercel link` to attach to project
3. Vercel Marketplace -> install **Upstash Redis** integration (free tier is fine)
4. Set all env vars from the table above
5. Generate Data Manager OAuth refresh token (see `OAUTH_REFRESH.md` history or run a fresh OAuth consent flow with scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datamanager + https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords`)
6. In Google Cloud Console: enable Data Manager API on `student-luxe-ads` project, add `http://localhost:8080` to OAuth client authorized redirect URIs
7. In Google Ads UI: set all 4 conversion actions to Count = Every, Step 4 click-through window = 90d, Enhanced Conversions for Leads ON (account-wide)
8. Push -> Vercel auto-deploy
9. Paste `public/squarespace-tracking-snippet.html` into Squarespace footer, edit TRACK_URL to your Vercel domain

## Setup Claude routine for daily digest

In Claude Code:
```
/schedule create a routine that fires daily at 09:30 Europe/London. Runs:
  curl -fsS "https://luxe-lead-capture.vercel.app/api/gads-daily-summary?secret=<CRON_SECRET>&hours=24"
```

The routine only fires when the Claude app is open. For bulletproof firing, add a Vercel cron entry instead.

---

## Verify after any change

1. `node --check api/<file>.js` syntax-check before push
2. `curl https://luxe-lead-capture.vercel.app/api/test-alert?secret=<CRON_SECRET>` -> sample failure email arrives
3. Submit a test enquiry on `/reservations?gbraid=TEST_xyz` -> Vercel logs show `Data Manager events:ingest OK` -> Monday row appears with all attribution columns populated -> dashboard `/dashboard-attribution.html` shows the lead within seconds
4. `curl ".../api/weekly-summary?secret=<CRON_SECRET>&days=7&dryRun=1"` -> JSON preview of last week's bookings + month total

Check Vercel logs:
```
vercel logs https://luxe-lead-capture.vercel.app --follow
```

## Migration history

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-07-06 | Built `/api/enrich-attribution`: backfills missing campaign / ad group / keyword / match type onto Leads by looking the stored gclid up in Google Ads `click_view` (authoritative ~90 days) and writing the result to Monday. Needed because under parallel tracking, UTM params in a tracking template never reach the landing page, and there is no valid ValueTrack macro for the campaign name. Read-only against the classic Ads API (`googleAds:search`), so the deprecated write path is untouched. Idempotent: filled leads drop out of the Monday-side filter. First backfill enriched 16 historical leads. |
| 2026-07-06 | Daily cron for `/api/enrich-attribution` at 06:00 UTC with a 3-day window (`maxAgeDays=3&lookback=10&limit=100`). Authenticates via the `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` header Vercel injects into cron calls, so no secret sits in `vercel.json`. Short window means unrecoverable leads (Meta/Display/expired) age out instead of being retried forever. |
| 2026-07-06 | Fixed `EVENT_TIME_INVALID` on `submit-enquiry.js`: event timestamp is now always server `new Date()`, never the client-supplied `submitted_at` (device clock skew or a stale/cached form load could push it outside Google's acceptable window). |
| 2026-07-06 | `submit-booking.js` + `submit-high-potential.js` stamp the event timestamp at webhook time, not lead/booking creation, to avoid `EVENT_TIME_INVALID` on old rows. |
| 2026-07-06 | Fixed booking conversion value lost on replay: the failure log now records the revenue value, and `replay-failed-events.js` refetches it straight from Monday. Bug had re-uploaded three failed bookings at £0. |
| 2026-07-06 | Added `isTransient400` retry to `_dataManager.js`: retries the generic `events.events[N]` 400 (intermittent Google-side rejection of otherwise valid payloads) alongside 5xx/429. Re-armed the temporary success pings. |
| 2026-07-06 | Built `/api/replay-failed-events`: rebuilds and re-uploads conversions from the KV `gads:events` fail log via EC for Leads, idempotent per Monday item id. |
| 2026-07-06 | `pushToMonday` (enquiry + stayluxe) retries `create_item` on transient Monday errors (`API_TEMPORARILY_BLOCKED`, rate limit, 5xx) with 2s/5s/10s backoff, was single-shot before. |
| 2026-07-06 | Duplicate detection: an IP-only match now also flags when the original lead is under 14 days old (same-household, e.g. parent + student on shared home wifi with unique names/emails/phones). |
| 2026-07-06 | Monday-failure rescue email now dumps the full tracking payload (campaign, adgroup, term, all click ids, session id, landing page, first-touch fields, visited paths, IP) so attribution is recoverable when the CRM write fails. |
| 2026-06-30 | Migrated all offline conversion uploads from Google Ads API v21 `uploadClickConversions` to Google Data Manager API `events:ingest`. Reason: Google deprecated the old path starting 15 Jun 2026. |
| 2026-06-30 | Removed `sync-customer-match.js` and its cron. Customer Match flow moves to a separate project. |
| 2026-06-30 | Flipped all conversion actions to Count = Every (gbraid/wbraid require it). EC for Leads enabled account-wide. Step 4 click window = 90d max. |
| 2026-06-30 | `submit-booking.js` + `submit-high-potential.js` now pull linked lead's first name + last name (text37 + text60) so name hashes contribute to EC for Leads matching. |
| 2026-06-26 | Weekly PPC summary fixed: was always £0 because the Monday query missed `display_value` on the mirror column. Now uses `date9` close date for accounting, with campaign name per booking. |
| 2026-06-26 | fbclid default channel changed from "Meta Advert" to "Instagram" — we don't run Meta ads, fbclid is auto-injected on any IG outbound link. |
| 2026-06-25 | Added 7 attribution columns to Monday Leads board (device, country, first_channel, first_campaign, gbraid, wbraid, session_id). |
| 2026-06-25 | Built attribution dashboard endpoint + iframe-replaced native React `AttributionView` in `luxe-organic-content/components/PpcPage.js`. |
| 2026-06-25 | Built `/api/track` + Upstash Redis KV session journal. |
| 2026-06-25 | Daily Google Ads upload digest + per-failure email alerts wired across all 3 conversion handlers. |
| 2026-06-25 | Squarespace footer snippet swapped `credentials: 'include'` -> `'omit'` to dodge wildcard-CORS preflight rejection. |

## Conventions (must follow)

- **Complete files always** — no snippets in chat, no partial edits referenced separately. Edit in place.
- **No em dashes anywhere** in code, comments, UI strings, docs. Use commas, colons, or restructure.
- **Stay Luxe handler parity** — `submit-stayluxe.js` mirrors `submit-enquiry.js` for everything except the Google Ads upload (Stay Luxe doesn't run ads).
- **Duplicate detection is not optional** — runs before every Monday write.
- **Retry on Monday API errors** — every Monday call needs retry logic.
- **Never commit secrets** — all keys in Vercel env, never in repo.
- **Vercel auto-deploys main** — pushing to GitHub deploys. No staging branch.

---

## Known issues / future work

- Google Ads UTMs live in a **tracking template**, not a Final URL suffix. Under parallel tracking (mandatory on Search) tracking-template params never reach the landing page, so only the auto-tagged gclid/gbraid land. On top of that, the campaign NAME has no valid ValueTrack macro and `{adgroupname}` is not a real macro (it lands as the literal string). Net effect: leads capture gclid but not campaign/adgroup/keyword at submit time. `/api/enrich-attribution` backfills all of it from `click_view` daily, so no Google Ads settings change is strictly required. If real-time keyword/matchtype capture at submit is ever wanted, move those macros into a Final URL suffix (account level).
- Recoverable ceiling for enrichment: Search + Shopping clicks on this account within `click_view`'s ~90-day window. Display/Demand-Gen/Search-Partners clicks, Meta fbclids, gbraid-only iOS clicks, and anything older than 90 days cannot be recovered.
- BENCHED: Step 3.5 "Qualified Leads" / pending-booking conversion. Idea: upload a booking to Google the moment a guest signals intent (pending / deposit), before it is confirmed. Decision from the 2026-07-06 analysis: do NOT put pending into Step 4 (it pollutes value-based bidding, some pending bookings cancel). If built, it must be its own conversion action ("Booking Requested") at a discounted value (estimated commission x measured close rate), keeping Step 4 = confirmed revenue only, run Secondary/observe-only first. Blockers to resolve before building: (1) RETRACT/RESTATE lives on the deprecated googleads.googleapis.com path we migrated OFF, confirm a removal op exists on Data Manager or accept never retracting; (2) Google's conversion-adjustment window is 55 days, student booking horizons can exceed that; (3) measure actual Step 4 volume first, if confirmed volume is already enough to bid on, the answer is a plain "no". Parked for now.
- Customer Match upload (`sync-customer-match.js`) deferred to a separate project. The Data Manager helper exposes `ingestAudienceMembers` ready to wire.
- Reservations form does not collect postcode. Once it does, the `address` identifier path in `buildUserIdentifiers` will start contributing to EC for Leads matching automatically.
- Daily Claude routine only fires when the laptop is awake. For bulletproof firing, add to `vercel.json` crons (timezone is UTC).
- `utmSourceToChannel` still emits "Meta Advert" if `utm_source=facebook/fb/meta` arrives explicitly. Rare but worth flipping to "Instagram" or adding a "Facebook" label in Monday if you want to differentiate organic from ads.
- `_lead-qualified-data.js` + `_lead-qualified-email.js` are from a separate webhook PR (Lead Qualified email redesign). Untouched by this attribution work.
